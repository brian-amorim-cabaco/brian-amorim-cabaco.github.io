            <p>
                <em>This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of merger waves in the U.S. since 1980. I estimate substantial costs from anticompetitive channels dominating efficiency gains. Firm-level evidence shows listed merging firms and acquirers’ competitors derive higher valuations from anticipated market power gains. I rule out alternative explanations including future takeover prospects and industry health signalling. Using a novel proxy for aggregate merger activity, I show consolidation waves predict persistent declines in economic activity, falling labor productivity, and rising inflation. A calibrated firm dynamics model with merger auctions and variable markups rationalizes these findings through worsened allocative efficiency and reduced firm entry.</em>

            <p>
            <em>We identify four dimensions of monetary policy in the Euro Area using narrative sign restrictions applied to high-frequency data. By leveraging well-known historical episodes—such as Mario Draghi's "whatever it takes" speech—we can separately identify conventional policy, forward guidance, quantitative easing, and asymmetric country risk premia shocks using a single narrative restriction per shock. After controlling for predictability in high-frequency asset movements and state-dependent variance in a Bayesian factor model, we find little evidence for the importance of information shocks. We use our measures of monetary policy shocks to estimate the aggregate dynamic causal effects of monetary policy. We implement a Bayesian VAR with distributed lags and stochastic volatility that allows for overidentifying restrictions on the impulse responses. We find that tightening along any monetary policy dimension causes declines in activity and inflation, but magnitudes vary across policy instruments. Forward guidance has marginal effects, while asset purchases show larger impacts, though both remain less powerful than conventional policy.

            <h4>The Macroeconomic Effects of Currency Movements</h4>
            <p>
            <em>I construct a granular instrumental variable for currency movements using financial fund equity flows into South Africa by building on Gabaix and Koijen (2021). I provide the first semi-structural estimates of exchange rate effects on macroeconomic aggregates in an emerging market. In South Africa, appreciations against the USD are inflationary and cause expansions in output and credit—responses resembling credit shocks rather than traditional trade effects. I document a powerful exchange rate credit channel: in countries with substantial foreign-denominated debt, local currency appreciations reduce debt burdens, spurring higher credit. These findings reveal that the USD matters both as the trade invoicing currency and the funding currency for debt. USD-denominated liabilities constrain domestic monetary policy autonomy in emerging markets while extending the reach of the US Federal Reserve, underscoring the need for international central bank cooperation.
